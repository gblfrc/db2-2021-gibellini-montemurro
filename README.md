## Description
This project was developed as part of the exam for the Database 2 course at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it) during the academic year 2021-22.
The aim of the project was building a simple website for a Telco company to offer customers the chance of purchasing service packets; the main focus of the work was, however, the back-end part of the application, i.e. the interaction with the database.

## Setup
The project is developed in JAVA and it uses some technologies which are proper of JAVA EE, like EJB and JPA: make sure the IDE on which you're interested to import the project is properly set up to run both the EJB and the WEB sections you find in this repository. In addition, you should also install on your IDE the [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) library which has been used to get rid of some boilerplate code; all information to do that are available on Lombok's website in the Install section.

Here are the pieces of software you need to have installed on your machine to correctly run the project
- DB server, like MySQL server;
- JAVA EE IDE, like Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers;
